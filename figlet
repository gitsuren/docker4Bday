Image creation from a container
Let’s start by running an interactive shell in a ubuntu container.

docker container run -ti ubuntu bash
As we’ve done in the previous lab, we will install the figlet package in this container.

apt-get update -y
apt-get install figlet
We then exit from this container

exit
Get the ID of this container using the ls command (do not forget the -a option as the non running container are not returned by the ls command).

docker container ls -a
Run the following command, using the ID retreived, in order to commit the container and create an image out of it.

docker container commit CONTAINER_ID
Once it has been commited, we can see the newly created image in the list of available images.

docker image ls
From the previous command, get the ID of the newly created image and tag it so it’s named ourfiglet.

docker image tag IMAGE_ID ourfiglet
Now we will run a container based on the newly created image named ourfiglet, and specify the command to be ran such as it uses the figlet package.

docker container run ourfiglet figlet surendra
As figlet is present in our ourfiglet image, the command ran returns the following output.
